## Blackjack
Blackjack is a card game in the player competes against the dealer. The objective of the game is to defeat the dealer in one of the following ways: 

	* Get 21 points (Blackjack) 
	* Attain a higher score than the dealer without exceeding 21 

The player and dealer are dealt two cards. The value of the cards is their face value. All face cards are worth 10 points and Aces are worth 1 or 11 points. The player is allowed to be dealt a card ("hit") each turn to improve their score or end their turn ("stand").   

Once a player is satisfied with their score and has not exceeded 21 ("bust"), the dealer must reveal his cards and continue to hit until the cards total value is 17 or more points. 

A player wins by not busting and having a higher total score than the dealer. 

Bets are placed before cards are dealt. If the player busts or loses to the dealer, they lose their bet. If a player wins he receives his bet 1:1 and if a player blackjacks they are paid 1.5:1.
